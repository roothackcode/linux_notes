Linux -> An operating System
	Features Of Linux :
		Free
		Open Source
		Full Access of Hardware
		Easily Customizable
Distribution : 	Redhat , -> Paid
		Centos, 
		Debian -KAli ,parrot
		Arch -> Black Arch, Garuda
Some Distribution Of Linux Is Paid
	Paid Linux :-> Redhat, Zorin OS

Objective To Study Linux : 
	Already Installed Tools
	Victim Machine can be a linux Based OS
What we Study in Linux : 
	Linux Administration 
		Users 
		Powers
		Tools
		Permissions
		Security
Kernal -> It is the mediator b/w Hardware and OS

Virtual Consoles :
	(tty-> teletype): There are 6 virtual Consoles
		Cli Interface 
		Shifting B/W the consoles : 
			console 1 -> ctrl + alt + f1
			console 2 -> ctrl + alt + f2
			upto console 7
		Login Screen working on 1st console
		then after the login i send you on 7th
		or 2nd

	Two Types Of Path : 
	1. Absolute Path -> / to destination folder
	        Example :                                           
		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
		└─$ cd /home/kali/Document
	
	2. Relative Path -> present working directory to destination
	        Example :                                           
		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
		└─$ cd Document
	
Commands : 
	cd 	-> Change directory
	cd 	-> send to home directory

		-p -> make subdirectory also
	rmdir 	-> remove blank directory
	rm 	-> remove file
		-r -> recursive
		Example : rm -rf dir_name -> remove filled directory
		-f -> forcefully
	cp 	-> copy  
		Usuage : cp source destination
		-r -> recursive --> To copy directory
	mv 	-> move and rename 
		Usuage : mv source destination

Links :
	1. Hardlink -> It is a duplicate copy of a file with auto update file  
	Command  : 
		ln  file.txt hardlink.txt
	2. Softlink -> It is a shortcut of the file
	Command :
		ln -s file.txt softlink.txt

Variables : value container
	Temporary -> can be make in terminal 
		can not available outside that terminal
		variable will be delete if terminal is closed
		Example : a=192.168.1.1
	Permanent -> It will work on all the terminals
		It is also available after reboot the machine
		Process : 
			->open the file .zshrc in editor in home dir
			->and add "export a=192.168.1.5"
			->and save the file
	$ -> Place before the variable name to Access The variable
Alias -> make long commands into short words 
	Temporary : 
	Example : alias l="ls -lh /home"
	Permanent : 
		Process : 
			->open the file .zshrc in editor in home dir
			->and add alias l="ls -lh /home"
			->and save the file



File Editors
